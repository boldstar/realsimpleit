excerpt: In the event of a disaster, are you able to restore your company’s critical software 
---

In the event of a disaster, are you able to restore your company’s critical software and applications in minutes rather than hours or days? No matter the size of your business, technology continues to change the way we operate. From servers processing information and storing large amounts of data, to employees using e-mail, VoIP, desktop computers, laptops and wireless devices to process, manage and communicate. 

But what if this all stopped working?
Why do I need a Disaster Recovery plan?

Ask yourself one simple question, ‘can my business still function without my critical data, applications and systems?’ If the answer is ‘no’, then a business disaster recovery plan should be high on your agenda,

It is inevitable that your data will be at risk at some point; whether it’s via a virus, machine error, human error or even a natural disaster. Downtime of your IT systems has a significant and costly impact on your business, causing a loss of productivity, reputation and can have serious commercial losses. Some businesses are never able to fully recover, and not having a business contingency plan in place could mean losing it all.

Having a disaster recovery plan in place is much like having an insurance policy for your business and data, should something unexpected happen.
