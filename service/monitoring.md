Monitoring means that a MSP doesn’t just fix something that has gone wrong, when they are made aware of it. The network should be constantly checked and the system managed to observe any changes that could potentially occur over time. A MSP should always be aware of the state of your system and able to prevent any future issues before they even occur.
