The only way to truly prevent system attack is to monitor your network in real time. We can easily detect events such as failed logons, failures due to bad passwords, security log tampering and account lockouts among other monitoring services. Auditing your system and network covers an important aspect of security and detection; it is your last line of defense. We believe it is crucial that you have in place a means of determining the state of your system and to detect unauthorized logins and system changes. We accomplish this through the use of specialized programs and applications.
